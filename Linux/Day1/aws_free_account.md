To create an AWS Free Tier account, you need to sign up on the AWS website, provide contact and billing information, verify your identity, choose a support plan, and complete the sign-up process. The Free Tier allows access to a limited set of AWS services for a year. 
Here's a step-by-step guide:
1. Go to the AWS Website: Navigate to the AWS homepage and click on "Create an AWS Account". 
2. Create Your AWS Account: Enter your email address, choose a password, and provide an AWS account name. 
3. Account Type Selection: Choose between a personal or business account. Personal and business accounts have the same free tier features. 
4. Contact Information: Provide your contact details, including your name, address, and phone number. 
5. Identity Verification: You'll need to verify your identity by entering a code sent to your email and phone number. 
6. Payment Information: Enter your credit or debit card details. AWS uses this for identity verification and to prevent abuse of the Free Tier. 
7. Support Plan: Choose a support plan. The free "Basic" plan is suitable for experimenting with the Free Tier. 
8. Account Confirmation: Complete the sign-up process and check your email for confirmation. Your account is usually activated within a few minutes, but it can take up to 24 hours.
