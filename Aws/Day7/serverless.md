### ðŸ“š **Three-Tier Serverless Architecture (with AWS)**

A traditional 3-tier app is made of:

1. **Presentation Tier (Frontend)**
2. **Application Tier (Logic/Backend)**
3. **Data Tier (Database)**

In **serverless**, these tiers are built using fully managed AWS services â€” no EC2, no manual scaling.

### âœ… 3-Tier Serverless Architecture Components on AWS

| Tier           | Purpose               | Serverless AWS Services                            |
| -------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Frontend    | UI (Web/App)          | **Amazon S3** (static site) + **CloudFront**       |
| 2. Application | Business Logic / API  | **Amazon API Gateway** + **AWS Lambda**            |
| 3. Data        | Store structured data | **Amazon DynamoDB** / **Amazon Aurora Serverless** |

---

### ðŸ”§ Optional/Supportive Services:

* **Cognito** â€“ Authentication
* **Route 53** â€“ Domain name
* **S3 Static Hosting** â€“ For React/Angular frontend
* **SSM Parameter Store / Secrets Manager** â€“ Store API keys/secrets
* **SNS / SQS** â€“ For async messaging
* **Step Functions** â€“ For workflows

---

### âœ… Architecture Flow:

```
User (Browser)
     â†“
CloudFront (CDN + Caching)
     â†“
S3 Static Website (HTML/JS/React)
     â†“
API Gateway (REST or HTTP)
     â†“
AWS Lambda (Runs logic)
     â†“
DynamoDB / Aurora Serverless (Stores data)
```

### ðŸ“¸ Real-World Example: Event Booking App

* **Frontend:** S3 + CloudFront (React)
* **API:** API Gateway routes to Lambda functions
* **Backend:** Lambda validates booking
* **Database:** DynamoDB table storing users, events, and bookings

## âœ… 10 Interview Questions & Answers on Serverless 3-Tier Architecture

---

### **Q1: What is a 3-tier architecture in cloud applications?**

**A:** It's a design pattern that splits an application into:

* **Presentation Layer** (UI),
* **Application Layer** (logic),
* **Data Layer** (storage).
  In AWS, this is achieved using S3 + Lambda + DynamoDB for a fully serverless stack.

---

### **Q2: How does AWS Lambda help in a serverless 3-tier architecture?**

**A:** Lambda hosts the application logic. It scales automatically and is cost-efficient â€” runs only when invoked. It processes HTTP requests from API Gateway and interacts with databases.

---

### **Q3: How do you make the frontend of a serverless app globally available and fast?**

**A:** Use **S3 static hosting** to host the web app and **CloudFront** for global CDN distribution, HTTPS, and caching.

---

### **Q4: What is the role of API Gateway in this architecture?**

**A:** API Gateway acts as the **entry point** for backend logic. It accepts HTTP requests, authorizes them, and routes them to the correct Lambda function.

---

### **Q5: How is state managed in serverless apps without EC2?**

**A:** State is stored externally in services like **DynamoDB**, **S3**, or **Aurora Serverless**. The logic (Lambda) is stateless by design.

---

### **Q6: What are the benefits of a serverless 3-tier architecture?**

**A:**

* Auto-scaling
* Lower cost (pay-per-use)
* Less maintenance (no servers to patch)
* Faster time to market
* Built-in high availability

---

### **Q7: How do you secure APIs in a serverless application?**

**A:**

* Use **API Gateway authorizers** (Cognito/JWT)
* Enable **IAM roles and policies**
* Use **Secrets Manager** or **SSM** to store API keys securely

---

### **Q8: How would you handle failure or retries in this architecture?**

**A:**

* Lambda has built-in retry logic
* Use **DLQs (Dead Letter Queues)** for failed invocations
* Use **Step Functions** for retries and error handling

---

### **Q9: How do you handle versioning and CI/CD in serverless apps?**

**A:**

* Use **SAM**, **Serverless Framework**, or **CDK**
* Integrate with **CodePipeline** or **GitHub Actions**
* Deploy Lambda versions and aliases for blue/green deployment

---

### **Q10: What are the limitations or challenges of a serverless 3-tier architecture?**

**A:**

* Cold starts in Lambda
* Vendor lock-in (tightly coupled with AWS)
* Harder debugging
* Lambda timeouts for long-running tasks
* Limited concurrency in some regions

## ðŸ§© Bonus Tip: CI/CD for Serverless

**CI/CD Toolchain** example:

* **Source:** GitHub
* **Build/Test:** GitHub Actions
* **Deploy:** AWS SAM / CDK / Serverless Framework
* **Monitor:** CloudWatch + X-Ray
