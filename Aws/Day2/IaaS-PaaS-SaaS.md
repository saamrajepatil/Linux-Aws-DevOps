## üèóÔ∏è Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS)

**IaaS** is a cloud computing model that delivers fundamental compute, storage, and networking resources over the internet. In **AWS**, IaaS offerings provide flexibility and control over the infrastructure layer.

### ‚úÖ Key Characteristics of AWS IaaS:

* **Examples:** Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud), Amazon EBS (Elastic Block Store), Amazon VPC (Virtual Private Cloud)

* **Scalability:** Easily scale compute, storage, and networking up or down as per demand.

* **Full Control:** Users manage operating systems, installed applications, middleware, and runtime environments.

* **Flexibility:** Ideal for lift-and-shift migrations and custom application stacks.

## üß± Platform as a Service (PaaS)

**PaaS** in AWS provides a platform to develop, run, and manage applications without managing the underlying hardware or OS. It accelerates development and reduces operational complexity.

### ‚úÖ Key Characteristics of AWS PaaS:

* **Examples:** AWS Elastic Beanstalk, AWS Lambda, Amazon RDS, AWS Fargate, Amazon API Gateway

* **Simplified Development:** Developers focus on code and business logic; AWS handles the infrastructure, OS patching, and provisioning.

* **Automatic Scaling:** Built-in support for autoscaling and load balancing based on traffic patterns.

* **Reduced Maintenance:** AWS manages updates, patches, and runtime environments.

## üñ•Ô∏è Software as a Service (SaaS)

**SaaS** delivers fully managed software applications over the web. End-users consume the service via a web browser without worrying about infrastructure or platform management.

### ‚úÖ Key Characteristics of AWS SaaS:

* **Examples:** Amazon WorkMail, Amazon Chime, Amazon Honeycode, third-party SaaS apps hosted on AWS Marketplace

* **Accessibility:** Available from anywhere with a browser and internet connection.

* **Managed by Providers:** The SaaS provider (AWS or third-party) manages software, infrastructure, updates, and security.

* **Subscription-Based:** Services are typically billed based on usage or subscriptions.

## üß† Choosing the Right Model in AWS

When deciding between **IaaS, PaaS, and SaaS** in AWS, consider:

| Criteria        | IaaS (e.g., EC2)              | PaaS (e.g., Lambda, RDS)      | SaaS (e.g., WorkMail, Chime) |
| --------------- | ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Control**     | Full control of OS & software | Control over app & code only  | No control; just use the app |
| **Maintenance** | User-managed                  | AWS manages infra & patching  | Fully managed by provider    |
| **Use Case**    | Custom apps, VMs, legacy apps | Web apps, APIs, automation    | Email, collaboration, CRM    |
| **Dev Focus**   | Infra setup and scaling       | Code and deployment logic     | Business functionality       |
| **Scaling**     | Manual or automated           | Auto scaling usually built-in | Abstracted to end-user       |
