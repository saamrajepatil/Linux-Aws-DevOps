In AWS, there are **3 main types of Elastic Load Balancers (ELB)**, each suited for different use cases. Here’s a breakdown with features and real-world examples:

---

## ✅ **1. Application Load Balancer (ALB)** – *Layer 7 (HTTP/HTTPS)*

### 🔹 **Best for:**

* Modern web apps, microservices, containers
* URL-based routing, host-based routing, and advanced request handling

### ⚙️ **Key Features:**

* Supports **path-based** (e.g., `/api`, `/admin`) and **host-based** routing (e.g., `api.example.com`)
* Native support for **containerized apps** (e.g., ECS with dynamic ports)
* **WebSocket support**, HTTP/2, and SSL termination

### 💡 **Use Case:**

> You have a React frontend (`/app`) and a Node.js API (`/api`) on the same domain — ALB routes traffic accordingly to different target groups.

---

## ✅ **2. Network Load Balancer (NLB)** – *Layer 4 (TCP/UDP)*

### 🔹 **Best for:**

* Ultra-high performance, low-latency apps
* Real IP preservation (source IP)
* Millions of requests/sec

### ⚙️ **Key Features:**

* Works at the **TCP/UDP layer**
* Can handle **static IP addresses** or use **Elastic IPs**
* Integrates with **PrivateLink**

### 💡 **Use Case:**

> A financial trading app or gaming backend where latency must be <1 ms and source IP needs to be logged.

---

## ✅ **3. Classic Load Balancer (CLB)** – *Legacy (Layer 4 & 7)*

### 🔹 **Best for:**

* Legacy apps using EC2-Classic
* Simple load balancing needs

### ⚙️ **Key Features:**

* Supports both HTTP/HTTPS and TCP
* No host/path-based routing
* Fewer features than ALB/NLB

### 💡 **Use Case:**

> A legacy Java application on EC2 launched before 2016 using only HTTP and no modern routing logic.

## 🧠 Bonus: Gateway Load Balancer (GWLB)

* **Purpose**: Load balance third-party virtual appliances (e.g., firewalls, IDS/IPS)
* **Use case**: Send all traffic through an inspection layer before reaching apps
