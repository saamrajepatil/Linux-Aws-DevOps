## ✅ **Demo Session Day 1: DevOps + Linux + AWS Introduction**

---

### 🧭 1. **What is a Server?**

* A **server** is a powerful computer that provides **resources, services, or data** to other computers (clients) over a network.
* Examples of servers:

  * Web server → hosts websites (like YouTube)
  * File server → stores and shares files
  * Database server → stores structured data (MySQL, PostgreSQL)

**Why do we need servers?**

* To run applications 24/7 (e.g., Gmail, Flipkart)
* To allow **multiple users** to access shared resources
* To centralize computing, storage, and control

---

### 🐧 2. **Why Linux Server?**

* **Linux** is a free and open-source operating system, preferred in servers for:

  * **Stability and Performance**
  * **Security**
  * **Customization**
  * **Community Support**
  * Used in **90% of cloud servers**, including AWS, Azure, and GCP
* Most **DevOps tools** run natively on Linux (Docker, Jenkins, Kubernetes, etc.)

### 🔄 3. **What is SDLC (Software Development Life Cycle)?**

| Phase       | Description                                  |
| ----------- | -------------------------------------------- |
| Requirement | Understand what to build                     |
| Design      | Plan how to build it                         |
| Development | Actual coding of the app                     |
| Testing     | Check if the app works correctly             |
| Deployment  | Move app to servers (live environment)       |
| Maintenance | Fix bugs and update features post-deployment |

### ⚙️ 4. **What is DevOps?**

* **DevOps** = Development + Operations
* A **culture and set of tools/practices** to:

  * **Automate** manual work (testing, deployment)
  * **Integrate** development and operations teams
  * **Deliver** software faster and with fewer errors

**DevOps Goals:**

* CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)
* Automation
* Monitoring
* Faster Releases

---

### 👨‍💻 5. **DevOps Engineer Role**

* Setup and manage:

  * Version Control (Git)
  * Build Tools (Maven)
  * CI/CD (Jenkins, GitHub Actions)
  * Containers (Docker)
  * Orchestration (Kubernetes)
  * Cloud Infrastructure (AWS, Azure)
  * Monitoring (ELK, Prometheus, Grafana)

---

### 🌐 6. **Why Learn Linux First?**

Because:

* All tools (Docker, Jenkins, etc.) run on Linux servers
* AWS EC2 uses Linux AMIs
* You need to work with:

  * Shell commands
  * File systems
  * Services
  * Logs

---

### 🔤 7. **Basic Linux Commands (Live Demo – 5 min)**

Use an EC2 instance or local VM:

* `pwd` – Print working directory
* `ls` – List files
* `cd` – Change directory
* `touch`, `mkdir`, `rm` – Create/delete files and folders
* `top`, `free -m`, `df -h` – Check memory, CPU, and disk
* `yum install` or `apt install` – Install packages

---

### ☁️ 8. **Why Learn AWS for DevOps?**

* Most companies are moving to **cloud**
* AWS is the **market leader (33% share)**
* DevOps tools run easily on cloud infrastructure
* You'll learn:

  * EC2 (Servers)
  * S3 (Storage)
  * IAM (Permissions)
  * VPC (Networking)
  * CloudFormation, Lambda, RDS, and more

---

### 📈 9. **Career Path & Salary**

* DevOps Engineers are in **high demand**
* Average salary (India):

  * 2–3 years: ₹8–15 LPA
  * 4–6 years: ₹15–25 LPA
* DevOps skills are **future-proof**

---

### ✅ 10. **Closing**

* Share your batch plan:

  * Week 1: Linux + Git
  * Week 2–3: AWS core
  * Week 4–5: Docker, Jenkins
  * Week 6–7: Kubernetes, Monitoring
  * Final Week: Real-time Projects + Interview Prep
